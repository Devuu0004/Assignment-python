    "# Exception handling is a way to gracefully manage runtime errors using try, except, else, and finally blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
    "# The finally block contains code that will run no matter what, whether an exception occurs or notâ€”typically used for cleanup.\n",

    "# Efficient memory management ensures optimal performance and prevents memory leaks.\n",

    "# try contains code that might raise an exception, and except handles the error if it occurs.\n",

    "# It uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to clean up unused memory.\n",
